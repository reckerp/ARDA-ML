\title{Exploring the Impact of Training Iterations on Object Detection Accuracy in Computer Vision}

\begin{abstract}
This paper focuses on exploring the relationship between the number of training iterations and the accuracy of object detection
in computer vision employing machine learning algorithms. A direct correlation between both was hypothesised. Meaning that as the number
of iterations increases, the accuracy of the model would increase as well. It was also hypothesised that at first the model would face
challenges, but then as the iteration count increases that the accuracy would steeply increase as well to then,
as it reaches close to 80\% accuracy, start to level off until it reaches its state of convergence. 
The experiment was conducted using Apple's CreateML framework and a dataset of around 9000 images was used to train the model.
The results of the experiment shed light on the relationship between both variables and proved that the hypothesis was mostly correct, 
but it became apparent that the accuracy did not level off as expected. Instead, the steep incline in accuracy continued to rise until
around 95\% accuracy before it started to level off.
