\subsection{Hypothesis}
Based on the context provided, it can be hypothesised that increasing the training iterations will directly impact the accuracy
of an object detection model. Furthermore, it can be assumed that both the loss and the percentage increase in accuracy between 
iterations, steadily decreases. This hypothesis is based on the fact that each additional iteration of training, will allow the model
to converge towards a more optimised state by adjusting its parameters to minimize the differences between the training and the test data.\\
It is anticipated that the greatest increase in accuracy will occur during the first iterations of the training process, as the
model initially will begin with 0\% accuracy and will rapidly develop a basic understanding of the objects after a few iterations. 
Concluding from this, it is expected that as the accuracy rises, the growth of accuracy will steadily decrease as the model nears its 
ideal state. In addition to the decrease in accuracy growth, it can be assumed that the loss resulting from the machine learning algorithm 
will show a decreasing trend over repeated training iterations.\\
In summary, a significant correlation between the accuracy and the number of training iterations is expected, which will gradually decrease as
the model approaches its peak state.
