## 1. Research Questions
### 1.1 Research Question
How does the number of training iterations a machine learning algorithm conducts affect the object detection accuracy in a computer vision program?

### 1.2 Secondary Research Questions
Does the kernel stride length affect the object detection accuracy

## 2. Variables
### 2.1 Independent Variable
Training iteration count (the number of times the data set is used for training the machine learning algorithm)

### 2.2 Dependent Variable
Accuracy of the computer vision program (the accuracy of the program identifying certain objects expressed as a precentage)

### 2.3 Controlled Variables
- Neural network
- Data set
- Test data
- Same Laptop specifications
