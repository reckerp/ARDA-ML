## 1. Research Questions
### 1.1 Research Question
How does the number of training iterations a machine learning algorithm conducts affect the object detection accuracy in a computer vision program?

### 1.2 Secondary Research Questions
Does the kernel stride length affect the object detection accuracy

## 2. Variables
### 2.1 Independent Variable
Training iteration count (the number of times the data set is used for training the machine learning algorithm)

### 2.2 Dependent Variable
Accuracy of the computer vision program (the accuracy of the program identifying certain objects expressed as a percentage)

### 2.3 Controlled Variables
- Neural network
- Data set
- Test data
- Same Laptop specifications 

## 3. Hypothesis
It can be hypothesised that increasing the number of training iterations a machine learning algorithm is trained with, will have a direct impact on the accuracy of the computer vision model. 
This can be predicted on the basis that each additional iteration of training for the program, will allow the given program to converge towards a more optimal solution by adjusting its parameters to minimize the differences between the training and test data. 

A further reason why a higher iteration count could lead to increased accuracy in object detection is, that the model will become more familiar with complex patterns due to its increased interaction with these patterns, in the training data. Therefore the program will be able to detect such patterns with a decreased level of error which will help the program's overall accuracy significantly. 

A further prediction can be stated that during the first few iterations, the greatest increase in accuracy should be visible. This will be because the program will initially begin with a 0% accuracy, as with no training the model will not be able to detect any objects yet. But then with a few training iterations, the model will rapidly develop a basic understanding of the objects and therefore the accuracy of the program will develop swiftly as well. Additionally, it can be expected, that as the program becomes more accurate, the growth of the accuracy will steadily decrease as the program nears its optimal state. Based on this it can be assumed that the amount of accuracy gained per training iterations will decrease as the state of the model develops and the accuracy increases. 

Overall it can be concluded that there should be a significant correlation between the accuracy and the training iterations for the experiment discussed.
